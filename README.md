# Kovaak Tracker

Some new format in the beta branch for Kovaak's was breaking fat-dash, so I decided to write my own app to get more detailed graphs and control.

I was lazy so this project just uses the dash, pandas, plotly, and numpy I have globally installed vs any type of managed environment
Run with `python .\kovaak_tracker.py` (or python3 if you need that) and graphs will show on localhost:8050
